    <h1>Happy Anniversary Sweetheart!</h1>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Hello Sweetheart...😘</strong></p>
    <p>1 year does sound like a bit alot but with you I never get to feel passing time.. This was the only year I can call as beautiful and erotic in my life just because of you my little shaitaan kitty.😘 Even after so many shitty incidents and so many brainless conflicts in my day to day life... You're the only shining star 🌟. Whatever the matter is, just listening your voice or thinking about you or actually seeing you makes my heart feel better. You're the only person I would like to have in my life and in my dreams. You've become my everything in just 1 year.. Even when you're Angry at me.. I find you astonishingly cute.. and Whenever you say "Meow".. I feel like I should come and give you so many kisses all over your body. Thankyou for being with your Nalayak Boyfriend and for tolerating me. I want to be with you for the rest of my life. I had left praying to God a long time ago.. but now if I pray to God.. I always ask them to give you a healthy and happy life because your smiling face makes me feel good... Happy Anniversary Kitty😘. You're THE best girl I or someone else could ever have in their life.. and you're the only reason of me wanting to live my life's every second and not giving up on anything. We will be together soon. I promise. BTW.. You're looking really hot in saree yesterday.. just Seeing you made my heart skip some beats.. 🤭😘</p>
    <p>I love you Mrs.Jigyasa Pratham Kamthan.❤️💕</p>
